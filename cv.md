#### Briefly About Myself: ####

In 2013 he graduated from the Academy of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Belarus, where he remained to serve. In August 2020, due to my unwillingness to take part in the ongoing lawlessness, I resigned from the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Since that moment and at the present time I have been trying to learn Frontend Development.
